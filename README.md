<a id="requirements"></a>
## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+** (recommended; tested on modern Windows Python)
- **Pygame** (for graphics and interaction)

<a id="installation"></a>
## Installation

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository

```bash
# Using Git
git clone https://github.com/nerkolt/Clustering_Visualizer_Game.git
cd Clustering_Visualizer_Game

# Or download and extract the ZIP file
```

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed. Then install Pygame:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install pygame

# Or if you're using pip3
pip3 install pygame

# On some systems, you might need:
python -m pip install pygame
```

#### Recommended (one command)

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check Python version (should be 3.7+)
python --version

# Check Pygame installation
python -c "import pygame; print(pygame.version.ver)"
```

<a id="how-to-run"></a>
## How to Run

Navigate to the project directory and run the main script:

```bash
# From the project root directory
python Scripts/Kmeans_Game_Debug.py

# Or if you're in the Scripts folder
cd Scripts
python Kmeans_Game_Debug.py
```

**Note:** `Scripts/Kmeans_Game_Debug.py` is the entry point. Most logic lives in the modular files under `Scripts/` (algorithms, scenes, datasets, rendering, CSV I/O).

<a id="build-windows-exe"></a>
## Build a Windows EXE (Release)

You can create a standalone Windows build using **PyInstaller**.

### Option A (recommended): one-folder build

From the project root:

```bash
tools/release/build_exe.bat onedir
```

Output: `dist/ClusteringVisualizerGame/ClusteringVisualizerGame.exe`

### Option B: single-file build

```bash
tools/release/build_exe.bat onefile
```

Output: `dist/ClusteringVisualizerGame.exe`

### Notes / troubleshooting

- The game uses **Tkinter file dialogs** for CSV import/export; in the EXE build the dialogs will open in your current folder (better UX).
- If Windows Defender flags the EXE, prefer the **one-folder** build (it’s usually less problematic than one-file).

<a id="build-windows-installer"></a>
## Build a Windows Installer (Setup.exe)

If you want a real installer for GitHub Releases (Start Menu shortcut + optional Desktop shortcut + uninstaller), use **Inno Setup**.

### Install Inno Setup

- Option 1: installer from the official Inno Setup website
- Option 2 (recommended): Chocolatey

```powershell
choco install innosetup -y
```

### Build installer (uses your icon + publisher)

```bat
tools/release/build_exe.bat installer
```

Output:
- `dist-installer/ClusteringVisualizerGame-Setup-<version>.exe`

Details:
- **Publisher**: Nour Ltaief
- **Icon**: `Assets/logo.png` converted to `.ico` during build

### GitHub Actions (automatic Release uploads)

This repo includes a workflow that builds the EXE + installer automatically when you push a version tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The workflow will attach these files to the GitHub Release:
- `dist-installer/ClusteringVisualizerGame-Setup-<version>.exe`
- `dist/ClusteringVisualizerGame/ClusteringVisualizerGame.exe`

<a id="data-mining-features"></a>
## Data Mining Features

### Inertia (WCSS) Metric

**Inertia** (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) measures how tightly points are clustered around their centroids. Lower inertia means better clustering!

- Displayed in real-time in the debug panel
- Tracked over iterations for the convergence graph
- Used in the elbow method to find optimal K

### Dataset Presets

Test K-Means on different data distributions:

- **Blobs** (`1`): 

![Clustering Visualizer Game](Assets/blobs.PNG)

Well-separated Gaussian clusters - perfect for K-Means

- **Moons** (`2`): 

![Clustering Visualizer Game](Assets/moons.PNG)

Two crescent-shaped clusters - challenges K-Means (non-linear)

- **Circles** (`3`): 

![Clustering Visualizer Game](Assets/circles.PNG)

Concentric ring clusters - another non-linear challenge


- **Random** (`4`): 


![Clustering Visualizer Game](Assets/random.PNG)

Uniform random distribution - baseline test

**Tip**: Try the Moons dataset with K=2 to see how K-Means struggles with non-linear data!

### Convergence Graph

![Clustering Visualizer Game](Assets/inertia.PNG)

Press `G` to toggle the convergence graph (top-left corner).

- Shows **inertia decreasing** over iterations
- Visualizes algorithm progress in real-time
- Helps identify when convergence is reached
- Updates automatically as the algorithm runs

**What to look for**: A downward trend that flattens out indicates convergence.

### Elbow Method

![Clustering Visualizer Game](Assets/Elbow.PNG)

Press `E` to run the elbow method analysis (bottom-right corner).

The elbow method helps you find the **optimal number of clusters (K)** by:
1. Testing K values from 1 to 10
2. Calculating inertia for each K
3. Plotting K vs Inertia
4. Finding the "elbow" point where adding more clusters doesn't help much

**How to read it**: Look for the point where the line bends sharply (the "elbow"). That's usually the optimal K!

**Note**: The elbow method may take a few seconds to compute as it runs the algorithm for each K value.

### Advanced Statistics Panel

Press `S` to toggle the advanced statistics panel (left side).

Displays comprehensive cluster quality metrics:

#### Overall Metrics
- **Inertia (WCSS)**: Total within-cluster sum of squares
- **Min Separation**: Distance between closest centroids

#### Per-Cluster Metrics
For each cluster (color-coded):
- **Size**: Number of points in the cluster
- **Avg Distance**: Average distance from points to centroid
- **Compactness**: Measure of how tightly packed the cluster is (higher is better)

**Use cases**:
- Compare cluster quality across different K values
- Identify unbalanced clusters
- Analyze cluster compactness and separation
- Validate clustering results

### In-class work (travaux pratiques)

This project builds on the **travaux pratiques** done in class (3DNI1) with **Yassine Net**, including:
- Running **K‑Means and DBSCAN** (assign → update → convergence)
- Interpreting clustering quality via **inertia/WCSS** and **the elbow method**
- Adding section of K-medoids that wasn't successfully applied .
- Comparing behavior on different dataset shapes (blobs vs non-linear shapes like moons/circles)

## 🎓 Understanding the Algorithms

### K‑Means (hard clustering)

K‑Means works in two main steps:

1. **Assignment**: Each point is assigned to the nearest centroid (based on Euclidean distance)
2. **Update**: Centroids move to the mean position of all points in their cluster

These steps repeat until:
- No points change clusters (convergence), or
- Maximum iterations are reached

**Watch it in action:**
- Points change color when reassigned to a different cluster
- Centroids smoothly move to the center of their clusters
- The algorithm converges when no more changes occur

### K‑Medoids (robust alternative)

K‑Medoids is similar to K‑Means, but uses **medoids** (actual data points) instead of the mean. It is often more robust to outliers.

### DBSCAN (density-based)

DBSCAN groups points by density using:
- `eps`: neighborhood radius (pixels)
- `min_samples`: points needed to form a dense region

Points that don’t belong to any dense region are labeled as **noise/outliers** (`-1`).

### Key Concepts (used throughout the app)

**Inertia (WCSS)**: Measures cluster quality by summing squared distances from points to their centroids. Lower inertia = tighter, better clusters.

**Convergence**: The algorithm stops when no points change clusters between iterations, meaning the clusters are stable.

**Optimal K**: Finding the right number of clusters is crucial. Too few = oversimplified, too many = overfitted. Use the elbow method (`E`) to help!

**Limitations**: K-Means assumes clusters are spherical and similar in size. Try the Moons (`2`) or Circles (`3`) datasets to see where it struggles.

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>
## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pygame'"**
```bash
# Solution: Install pygame
pip install pygame
```

**"Python not found" or "python: command not found"**
```bash
# Try using python3 instead
python3 Scripts/Kmeans_Game_Debug.py

# Or check if Python is in your PATH
```

**Low FPS or performance issues**
- The code is optimized, but with 500+ points you may see some slowdown
- Try reducing the number of points (press `P` and enter a smaller number)
- Close other applications to free up system resources

**Window doesn't appear**
- Make sure you're running the correct file: `Kmeans_Game_Debug.py`
- Check for error messages in the terminal
- Verify pygame is installed correctly: `python -c "import pygame"`

<a id="customization"></a>
## Customization

You can easily customize the game in the modular files:

- **Window size / UI layout / palette**: `Scripts/config.py`
  - `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`, `UI_PANEL_HEIGHT`, `COLORS`, `BG_COLOR`, etc.
